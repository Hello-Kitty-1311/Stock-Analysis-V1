# Stock Market Analysis

it lets you to look the stocks and to see their future prices it got graph that shows how the prices have changed over time and you can even see its performance.

## Why i made this ipynb

i got into stocks becuase of my uncle told me i could make easy money but turns out its not that easy lol i was always having to go to different websites to check prices and stuff and it was just a pain so i was like you know what ill just make my own thingy that shows me everything i wanna know and thats how this started plus my uncle will be so impressed he's gonna love it i think the graphs look realy cool.

## How i made it

* its python code in the jupyter notebook
* i used yfinance , pandas , numpy , matplotlib , seaborn , statsmodels , arch , scikit-learn , imbalanced-learn , tensorflow , torch , alpha-vantage , pykalman , gym , xgboost , lightgbm and prophet libraries.
* also matplotlib for the graphs becuase everyone uses that i think
* theres some api calls in there too to get the stock data
* i tried to explain everything in the notebook with comments so its not too confusing

## Struggles and what i have learned

* getting all libraries stuff right was kinda hard i kept messing up the dataframes
* but i think i got the hang of it now learned a lot about cleaning data
* figuring out the right api calls took a while too they have all these weird options
* jupyter notebooks are cool becuase you can see all your results right there in the notebook
* im getting better at this whole coding thing i think maybe ill make a real app next time haha

## usage of AI

* Error Lens : finds error in realtime
* Amazon Q Cli : real time code suggestion and explains error
* ChatGPT and Claude : solves bigger porblems
